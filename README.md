# Daily-Todo-React

The aim of this project is to create a web application in which daily tasks can be entered, creating a list of entries which may then be edited or removed. 

By creating this application, I will be practicing and learning more about React, which is my overarching goal for this project. 

### Learning objectives and skills exercised:

* Passing props to components. 
* Setting state using hooks (Setting a Todo item and passing it to the list.)
* Using uuid to create unique keys per Todo item. 
* Creating a pleasing front end experience for clarity of the day ahead.
